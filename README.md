    # Prediction Assignment Writeup

  This project use data set including measurement from accelerometers on the belt, forrear, are and dumbbell of 6 subjects. The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise and explore how well they do it with variable "classe" in the training set.  In this report, it describes how model was built, how cross validation was used , what the expected out of sample error was, and why the choices were made . Also, the built prediction model was applied to predict 20 different test cases for a quia.    

The submission for the Peer Review projet consist of a link to a Github repo with R markdown and compiled HTML file describing the analysis.
